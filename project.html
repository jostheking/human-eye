    <p style="text-align: center;">HUMAN EYE</p>
    <h2>PART OF EYE :</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>SCLERA :</h3>
    <P>It is the outermost covering of the eye . It is made of white tough fibrous tissues . It protects the vital internal parts of eye from external injuries .</P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>CHOROID :</h3>
    <P>The dark grey pigmented layer attached to the sclera on its inner side is called the choroid . It is richly supplied with blood vessels . It darkens the eye from inside and hence , prevents any internal reflection</P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>cornea :</h3>
    <p>The sclera layer continues in the front of the eye as cornea . It is tye transparent white portion of eye that covers the transparent bulge on the surface of the eyeball . It allows the light to enter into the eyeball .  </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>RETINA : </h3>
    <P>It is the innermost delicate membrane having a large number of cells called "rods" and "cones" . The cones sensitive to bright lights and can detect colour,whereas rods or senitive to dim lights .  </P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>IRIS AND PUPIL : </h3>
    <P>Behind the cornea is the iris . It lends colour to the eye . The amount of pigmentation in the iris gives colour to the eyes . When the pigmentation is the highest , the iris is black or brown in colour . When the pigmentation is least ,the iris is blue in colour . the iris has a central circular aperture called pupil . The iris regulates the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil in the following ways : </P>
    <br>
    <p>(a) If the light is dim , the iris expands the pupil in order to allow more light to enter the eye . </p>
    <br>
    <p>(b) If the light is bright , the iris contracts in order to make the pupil decrease the amount of light entering the eye . The iris consists of muscles that expand and contract the pupil .  </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> CRYSTALLINE LENS : </h3>
    <p>It is a transparent crystalline double convex lens situated just behind the iris . It is held in its position with the help of ciliary muscles . </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>SUSPENSORY LIGAMENTS :</h3>
    <P>Along with the ciliary muscles , suspensory ligaments are also attached to the lens . </P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>CILIARY MUSCLES : </h3>
    <P>Thes are the muscles that hold the eye lens in the proper place . The focal length of the eye lens can be changed with the help of ciliary muscles according to the distance of the object in front of the eye . When the ciliary muscles contract , the eye lens become thick and its focal length decreases . When the ciliary muscles are relaxed , the eye lens become thin and its focal length increases . </P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>OPTIC NERVE : </h3>
    <P>Optic nerve consist of about one million separate nerve fibers that connect the rods and cones of the retina to the brain .  Its function is to carry optical messages in the form of electic signals to the brain .  </P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>AQUEOUS HUMOUR : </h3>
    <P>The space of the eye between cornea and the eye lens is filed with a clear watery fluid which is known as aqueous humour . </P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>VITREOUS FLUID : </h3>
    <P>The space between retina and the eye lens is filled with a fluid called vitreous fluid . It keeps the eye wet . It is mainly composed of water . It occupies two-third of the volume of the eye .  </P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>BLIND SPOT : </h3>
    <P>At the junction of the optic nerves and the retina , there are no sensory nerves (rods or cones) . So , no vision is possible at that spot . This is called the blind spot of the eye .  </P>
